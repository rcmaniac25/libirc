libIRC
========================================================================

libIRC is a cross-platform framework for connecting to and interacting
with Internet Relay Chat (IRC) networks. libIRC is useful as the
foundation for embedding IRC capabilities into various applications
such as chat clients, games, and IRC bots.


PROJECT OVERVIEW

The libIRC library includes a C++API.  The C++ API
essentially consists of client and server objects that may be used for
talking to IRC servers and clients respectively.  


INSTALLATION

If you are on Windows, there are .NET project files in the vc7.1
directory.  For everyone else, the usual GNU Build System is used.

./configure
make
make install

Developers working out of CVS have an additional initial:

sh autogen.sh

Run autogen.sh before ./configure to initialize and generate the build
structure.  This step requires the latest versions of the entire GNU
Build System application suite (m4, aclocal, automake, autoconf,
libtool).

TESTING AND EXAMPLES

Example clients and servers are provided in the "tests" directory.
See those for quick and mostly short examples on how to quickly get
started with the API.


DISTRIBUTION DETAILS

The libIRC library is provided under the terms of the LGPL.  See the
COPYING file for more information.


COMMUNICATION AND GETTING HELP

There are forums, mailing lists, bug tracking, patches, feature
requests, task tracking, news, and support available on the project
website at http://sourceforge.net/projects/libirc/.
