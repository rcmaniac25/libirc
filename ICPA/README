ICPA ( IRC Client of Penultimate Awesomeness )
========================================================================

ICPA is a cross-platform IRC client framework for connecting to and
interacting with Internet Relay Chat (IRC) networks. It uses libIRC
and is intended to be a real world test app for it.


PROJECT OVERVIEW

ICPA is envisioned as a multi part IRC client. It will consist of 2 core
compoents. The first is a small headless IRC connection application 
that handles the connections to IRC servers. The second is the acctual
client application that presents the IRC information to the user and 
receives the input to be passed to the IRC servers. The headless app
does not have to be running on the same computer as the user client. This
can allow the headless application to maintain a permenant connection
to the IRC servers, and continue to collect and log channel information
when the user client is disconecnted. There can also be any number of
user clients, ranging from full graphical clients, like x-chat and pidgin
to command line clients like irssi.

A user can connect user clients from anywhere on the internet and still
maintain channels, settings, and logs regardless of the user client chosen.
